We use logstash for doing log based analytic at kPoint.
As we did more work on this, we realized that using this
tool chain in QA can help us reveal lots errors, which
typically do not result into user visible behavior.

In this talk I discuss the usage of logstash + Elasticsearch + Kibana
in QA to get insight into product logs and find issues,
which typically are hidden in dump of log files.
